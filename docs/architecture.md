How the Flow Works Together
	1.	Data Ingestion:
The ingestion modules (scraper, API connectors, RSS reader) collect raw news data from various sources. This data is then passed to the processing layer.
	2.	Data Processing:
The processing layer cleans and normalizes the raw data, storing it in configured databases or blob storage. Caching mechanisms are employed to speed up frequently accessed data.
	3.	Summarization & Story Tracking:
The summarization engine generates concise summaries using LLM-based methods, while the story tracking module clusters related articles to form coherent stories. Cached summaries improve response time for repeated requests.
	4.	Backend Orchestration:
Microservices handle discrete responsibilities (ingestion, processing, summarization, and story tracking). The API gateway exposes REST endpoints for external clients, and the realtime service delivers live updates.
	5.	Frontend Delivery:
The web interface (and, eventually, mobile apps) consumes data from the backend API. Dynamic JavaScript updates the UI with news summaries and notifications, ensuring an engaging user experience.
	6.	Monitoring & Deployment:
CI/CD, Docker, and Kubernetes configurations ensure the project is built, deployed, and maintained in a scalable and production-ready environment. Logging provides valuable insights for troubleshooting and performance optimization.

Final Summary

This architecture follows a microservices paradigm where each module is dedicated to a specific responsibility. The decoupled design enables independent development, testing, and scaling. The API gateway and real-time communication services provide a unified interface to external clients, while DevOps and monitoring tools ensure reliable and scalable deployment.

Key Points:
	•	Ingestion Layer: Feeds raw news data into the system.
	•	Processing Layer: Cleans and normalizes data, making it ready for summarization.
	•	Summarization Engine: Generates concise summaries and tracks related stories.
	•	Backend Services: Orchestrate business logic and expose APIs.
	•	Frontend Interface: Consumes APIs and displays information dynamically.
	•	Monitoring & DevOps: Ensure containerization, continuous integration, scalability, and observability.

Every component interacts through well-defined interfaces, ensuring that raw data flows smoothly from collection to display while remaining scalable, testable, and maintainable. As the project evolves, additional modules (e.g., advanced analytics or personalized recommendations) or further integration tests can be added without disrupting the overall architecture.

This comprehensive architectural guide ensures that any software engineer or team member can understand the system’s design, extend its functionality, or integrate new components with confidence. There is nothing essential missing at this stage; however, further domain-specific enhancements may be introduced as requirements evolve.
