## Phases & Steps

### Phase 1: Project Setup & Planning

1. **Requirements Gathering & Planning**
   - Define functional requirements (e.g., sources, summarization options).
   - Define non-functional requirements (scalability, performance, compliance).
   - Outline the system architecture (refer to the architectural guide).

2. **Setup Project Repository**
   - Initialize a Git repository.
   - Create project directories using the provided bash scripts (Parts 1–4).
   - Write initial README.md and documentation files.

3. **Setup Environment**
   - Create a virtual environment.
   - Install required dependencies from `requirements.txt`.
   - Create and configure the `.env` file with database and API keys.

---

### Phase 2: Data Ingestion & Integration

1. **Web Scraper Development**
   - Implement the scraper module (`ingestion/scraper/scraper.py`) using Requests and BeautifulSoup.
   - Test the scraper on a few sample news websites.
   - Ensure proper error handling and compliance with robots.txt.

2. **API Connector Implementation**
   - Build the API connector (`ingestion/api_connectors/api_connector.py`) to fetch data from external news APIs.
   - Parse and validate JSON responses.
   - Handle rate limiting and authentication (using API keys from `.env`).

3. **RSS Reader Development**
   - Develop the RSS reader module (`ingestion/rss_reader/rss_reader.py`) using the `feedparser` library.
   - Parse RSS feeds and extract headlines and metadata.

4. **Integration Testing (Ingestion)**
   - Write unit tests to validate each ingestion module.
   - Ensure that all modules return data in a consistent format.

---

### Phase 3: Data Processing & Storage

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Implement cleaning functions in `processing/preprocessing/preprocess.py` (strip HTML, trim text, deduplicate).
   - Write tests for data normalization.

2. **Storage Configuration**
   - Define and document storage parameters in `processing/storage/config.py`.
   - Implement functions to store processed data (simulate with files or a simple DB).

3. **Caching Setup**
   - Implement caching in `processing/caching/cache.py` using Redis.
   - Test caching functions to ensure quick data retrieval.

4. **Integration Testing (Processing)**
   - Validate that data flows from ingestion to processing correctly.
   - Ensure that caching and storage configurations work as expected.

---

### Phase 4: Summarization & Story Tracking

1. **LLM Summarization Service**
   - Develop the summarization module in `summarization/summarization_service/summarize.py`.
   - Integrate with an LLM API (or simulate with placeholder logic).
   - Support multiple summary styles (default, “Opposite Sides”, “Explain Like I’m 5”).

2. **Story Clustering Module**
   - Implement clustering logic in `summarization/story_tracking/story_tracking.py` using NLP techniques (e.g., KMeans).
   - Test the clustering with dummy embeddings and validate groupings.

3. **Summary Caching**
   - Develop caching for summaries in `summarization/summary_cache/summary_cache.py`.
   - Ensure that once a summary is generated, it is stored and reused.

4. **Integration Testing (Summarization)**
   - Verify that clean processed data can be summarized and grouped into stories.
   - Validate caching efficiency and consistency.

---

### Phase 5: Backend & API Development

1. **Microservices Implementation**
   - Implement individual microservices:
     - `backend/microservices/ingestion_service.py`
     - `backend/microservices/processing_service.py`
     - `backend/microservices/summarization_service.py`
     - `backend/microservices/story_tracking_service.py`
   - Each microservice should call the respective modules from previous layers.

2. **API Gateway Setup**
   - Develop the Flask-based API gateway in `backend/api_gateway/api_gateway.py`.
   - Expose endpoints (e.g., `/summarize`, `/track`) that delegate to microservices.
   - Implement proper error handling and data validation.

3. **Real-time Communication**
   - Implement real-time notifications using `backend/realtime/realtime.py` with Flask-SocketIO.
   - Integrate basic SocketIO events for live updates.

4. **Integration Testing (Backend)**
   - Test REST endpoints using tools like Postman.
   - Verify that the API gateway correctly routes requests to the microservices.
   - Validate real-time updates with a simple client.

---

### Phase 6: Frontend & User Interface

1. **Web Interface Development**
   - Develop the main HTML page (`frontend/web/index.html`), styling (`style.css`), and behavior (`app.js`).
   - Use AJAX (or fetch API) to connect to the API gateway and display summarized news.
   - Implement basic navigation and display elements for dynamic content.

2. **Mobile Interface Guidelines**
   - Document mobile app development strategies in `frontend/mobile/README.md`.
   - Choose a framework (e.g., React Native, Flutter) and plan for future mobile-specific development.

3. **Integration Testing (Frontend)**
   - Ensure that the frontend can fetch data from the API gateway.
   - Validate UI responsiveness and dynamic content updates.

---

### Phase 7: Integration, Testing & CI/CD

1. **Write Comprehensive Tests**
   - Develop unit tests for each module and integration tests for end-to-end flows (using pytest).
   - Organize tests under the `tests/` directory.

2. **CI/CD Configuration**
   - Set up CI/CD using the provided `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.
   - Ensure tests run automatically on code pushes and pull requests.

3. **Documentation Updates**
   - Update `README.md` and `docs/architecture.md` as features are added.
   - Maintain detailed change logs and module documentation.

---

### Phase 8: Deployment & Monitoring

1. **Containerization**
   - Build Docker images using the `Dockerfile` (in project root or `monitoring/ci_cd/`).
   - Use `docker-compose.yml` to run multi-container setups for local testing.

2. **Orchestration with Kubernetes**
   - Deploy services using the provided Kubernetes manifest (`monitoring/autoscaling/news_aggregator_deployment.yaml`).
   - Configure load balancing and auto-scaling policies.

3. **Logging & Monitoring**
   - Integrate logging using the `monitoring/logging/log_config.yml` configuration.
   - Set up monitoring dashboards (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) for production environments.

4. **Final Integration Testing**
   - Validate end-to-end flows in a staging environment.
   - Ensure that real-time updates, API responses, and UI rendering work as expected under load.
